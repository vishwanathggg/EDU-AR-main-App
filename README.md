# Brief description of innovative solution 

Our solution is completely based on a smartphone application.
 This application is supported on both  Android and iOS platforms.
 Users must download the AR application from the respective Android and iOS application stores.
 Once the user has installed her AR application on their smartphone, they need to launch the application.
 Once launched, users will be required to enter their details for registration purposes.
 Alternatively, users can log in using their credentials.
 After logging into the application, users can select specific areas of  interest that they would like to explore.
 After that, you will be redirected to select the concept related to the course, and after selection, click on the concept you want to display in  real time in the 3D field, the device's camera will be activated and the user will have to scan the relevant target image.
 Once the device recognizes the target image, a 3D model of the academic concept is projected onto the target image in real-time visual animation and automatically adapts to the user's dimensions with features such as virtual buttons.
 All of this  is achieved through the concept of expansion.
